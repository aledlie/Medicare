You just need to write two scripts (see the example files in the 04Shiny directory):**  \n\n* ui.R : Defines the layout and the interactive elements that the user can access.  \n* server.R : Defines what computations are done in response to user interactions. \n\nSee also http://shiny.rstudio.com and http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial \n\nTo run the shiny app that's in the 04Shiny directory run the following in the main RWorkshop directory (make sure the working directory is set to this directory):  \nlibrary(shiny)  \nrunApp(\"04Shiny\")   # Make sure there are no spaces in the string argument to runAPP\n\nThis should pop the application up in a browser, you can also access it in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:6837. \n\n###shinyapps\n\nThe example above ran the shiny app on your local machine, but to share with others, you have to send around the R files and the user needs to have R and know a little bit about it.\n\nInstead, you can remotely host shiny apps and then just send people links. Get a free account at shinyapps.io/signup.html and give it a try.\n\n**library(\"devtools\", lib.loc=\"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library\")  \ninstall_github( repo = \"shinyapps\", username=\"rstudio\" )  \nshinyapps::setAccountInfo(name='pcannata', token='3ECF447A741004F6A8B7208C9ED778E1', secret='. . .
